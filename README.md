# neocolorizer.nvim
A neovim plugin used for creating a neovim theme from a user provided color palette that can be refreshed on each start. The structure of this plugin is based off pywal16.nvim since it already makes it quite effortless to integrate into the hot-reload feature of my home-manager configuration.
